# 🚀 Dynamic Array Implementation (C++)

> A clean and simple **Dynamic Array implementation from scratch** using C++.  
> Built to understand how core data structures work behind the scenes.

---

## ✨ Features
•
Dynamic memory allocation  
•
Push & Pop operations  
•
Index-based access using `operator[]`  
•
No STL containers used  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
•
How dynamic arrays grow and shrink in memory  
•
Core memory management concepts  
•
Why modifying a structure while iterating can cause logical bugs  
•
The difference between **Array behavior** and **Stack behavior**

## 🛠 Tech Stack
```txt
Language : C++
Focus    : Data Structures & Memory Management

clsDynamicArray arr;

arr.push(10);
arr.push(20);
arr.push(30);

arr.pop();
